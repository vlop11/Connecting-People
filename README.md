U-REACH
U-REACH is an innovative web service that allows college students from most  major Georgia colleges to connect with people of similar interests that are loving within their very own campus.

Simply login with your Google account and fill out your profile to get instantly matched with others who share your same interests. Keep in mind that if there are less than 20 users that share your interests at your university, our algorithm will automatically pair you with anyone who attends your college.

U-REACH was made in collaboration by Valeria L., Emma B., and Jathan C.
